Customer Sentiment analysis

Project Description:

The goal of the Customer Sentiment Analysis Project is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study the emotional tone behind customer feedback, reviews, and social media mentions. This analysis will enable our organization to understand customer sentiments towards our products, services, and overall brand. By automating the sentiment analysis process, we aim to capture real-time insights into customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and enhance customer experience. This project will not only help in monitoring brand reputation but also in tailoring marketing strategies, improving product features, and addressing customer concerns more effectively. Through this endeavor, we anticipate strengthening customer loyalty, increasing engagement, and fostering a positive brand perception in a competitive market landscape.

Dataset Description:

The dataset, designed for financial sentiment analysis, is an amalgamation of the FiQA and Financial PhraseBank datasets. It encompasses a structured format of 5,842 rows and two distinct columns. These columns are detailed as follows:

    Sentence: This column contains various statements related to financial matters.
    
    Sentiment: This column categorizes the interpretation of each statement into one of three sentiment classes: negative, neutral, or positive.

This  dataset aims to provide a comprehensive foundation for analyzing and understanding the sentiment embedded within financial discourse.
